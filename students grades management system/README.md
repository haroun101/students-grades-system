# Student Grades Management System

This is a C++ console application that manages student data and their grades. The program allows you to:

- Add students and their grades (3 subjects).
- Remove a student by name.
- Display the top student based on total grades.
- Show highest and lowest grades among all students.
- Show the student who has the highest or lowest grade.
- Get highest and lowest grades for a specific student.
- Display detailed information (total, percentage, average) for a specific student or all students.
- Rate students based on their total grades.

Grades are validated to be integers less than or equal to 50. The program also sorts grades in descending order for each student.

## How to run

1. Compile the program using a C++ compiler.
2. Run the executable.
3. Follow the menu options to manage students and grades.
